# Metadata — Creating and Publishing a Website Using GitHub Pages and Jekyll

**Context:**  
Self-initiated technical writing sample demonstrating a complete beginner-to-intermediate workflow for building and publishing a website using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Git. This tutorial showcases real tooling, accurate steps, and environment-specific instructions (Terminal, Code Editor, GitHub UI).

**Audience:**  
Beginners who are new to Git, GitHub, Markdown, or static site generation, and need a guided path to creating their first personal website. Ideal for learners in tech, students, and early-career developers.

**Purpose:**  
To demonstrate my ability to write a full software/web documentation tutorial that involves:  
- multiple tools  
- multi-step setup  
- configuration files (YAML)  
- command-line workflows  
- Git/GitHub collaboration concepts  
- common user pain points (PAT, branch names, etc.)

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Software tutorial writing  
- Accurate step-by-step task breakdown  
- Clear tool/environment labeling (Terminal, Code Editor, GitHub website)  
- Use of Markdown for documentation  
- Explanation of configuration files (`_config.yml`)  
- Git workflow documentation (clone, commit, push)  
- Awareness of modern GitHub authentication requirements (PATs)  
- Anticipation of common errors and misunderstandings  
- Incorporation of screenshots or visual placeholders

**Tools Used:**  
Git, GitHub, Jekyll, Markdown, YAML, command-line interface, VS Code.

**Reflection:**  
This sample shows how I teach a multi-step technical workflow in a way that’s approachable, correct, and beginner-friendly. It highlights my understanding of Git/GitHub fundamentals, static site generation, file structures, configuration, and common user failure points. It also demonstrates my ability to test instructions, revise for clarity, and provide guidance across different tools and contexts.
