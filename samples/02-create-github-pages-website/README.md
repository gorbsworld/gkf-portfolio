# 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Git installed ✔
Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### A GitHub account ✔
Sign up: https://github.com/

### A code/text editor ✔  
Examples: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom.

### Basic familiarity with the terminal ✔
You will run simple commands like:
```
git clone
git add
git commit
git push
```

# 2. Create Your GitHub Pages Repository

1. Log into GitHub.  
2. Click **New Repository**.

4. Name your repository:

```
yourusername.github.io
```

This naming format is required for GitHub Pages user sites.

4. Set visibility to **Public**.  
5. Do **not** initialize with a README (we’ll add files manually).  
6. Click **Create repository**.

## 3. Clone the Repository (Terminal Only)

🖥 **Where this step happens:** Terminal / Command Prompt<br />

Run the following command in your terminal (replace with your actual username):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
```

This downloads your repository and creates a **new folder** on your computer with the same name as the repo.

Next, still in the terminal, move into that folder:

```bash
cd YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
```

> **Tip:** If `cd` doesn't work, run `ls` (Mac/Linux/Git Bash) or `dir` (Windows) to confirm the folder name.

## 4. Add the Jekyll Theme (Code Editor Only)

**Where this step happens:** Your code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

1. Open your code editor.  
2. Open the cloned folder (`YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`).  
3. Create a new file named:

```
_config.yml
```

4. Paste the following YAML into the file:

```yaml
title: My Portfolio
description: A simple website built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
theme: minima
```

5. Save the file.

This file tells GitHub Pages which theme to apply to your site.


**Explanation:**
- `theme:` sets your site’s look and layout  
- `title:` appears in site header/title  
- `description:` appears in metadata

# 5. Create Your Homepage Using `index.md`

**Where this step happens:** Your code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)  

Create a file named:

```
index.md
```

Add:

```markdown
---
layout: home
title: Welcome
---

# Welcome to My Portfolio

This site is powered by **GitHub Pages** and styled with the **Minima** Jekyll theme.

Here you'll find examples of my technical writing, tutorials, and documentation projects.
```

This Markdown file becomes your homepage.

# 6. Commit and Push Your Changes

In the terminal:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial site files"
git push origin main
```

If your default branch is `master`, replace `main` with `master`.

### Important: GitHub now requires a Personal Access Token (PAT)

GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for Git operations over HTTPS.  
If Git asks you for a password when running `git push`, you must use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of your GitHub password.

To create a PAT:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens  
2. Choose “Tokens (classic)”  
3. Generate a token with the `repo` scope  
4. Copy the token (you won’t be able to see it again)  
5. When Git asks for your password, paste the token instead

Your GitHub username stays the same; only the password is replaced with the token.

---

# 7. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.  
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**.

3. Under **Source**, choose:
- Branch: `main`
- Folder: `/ (root)`

4. Click **Save**.

GitHub will now build your site.

---

# 8. View Your Live Website

After a few moments, your site will appear at:

```
https://yourusername.github.io
```

If it doesn’t load immediately:
- Wait 1–2 minutes  
- Refresh your browser  
- Verify the Pages settings

# 9. Optional Enhancements

### Add an About Page
Create `about.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: About
---

# About Me
I’m a technical writer specializing in audio, web, and software documentation.
```

Link it from your homepage or navigation.

---

### Add navigation links (Minima theme)
Add this to `_config.yml`:

```yaml
header_pages:
  - index.md
  - about.md
```

---

### Add images
Create an `/assets` folder and reference images like:

```markdown
![My photo](/assets/profile.jpg)
```

---

### Customize theme colors (advanced)
You can override CSS by adding files under `/assets/css/`.

---

# 10. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|------|--------|----------|
| Site shows 404 | Pages not enabled | Check Settings → Pages |
| YAML error | Incorrect spacing/indentation | Use spaces, not tabs |
| Theme not applying | Wrong theme name | Use only supported GitHub Pages themes |
| Changes not updating | Cached build or commit not pushed | Refresh / run `git push` |
| Build failed | Unsupported plugin | Remove plugins from `_config.yml` |

---

# Conclusion

- Git and GitHub command workflows  
- Use of Markdown  
- Use of YAML configuration  
- Ability to publish and maintain web documentation  
- Understanding of static site generators  

Perfect for showcasing in a technical writing portfolio.
