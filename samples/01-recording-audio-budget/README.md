# Recording High-Quality Audio on a Budget

## Overview
This guide helps beginners set up an affordable home recording workflow capable of producing clean, high-quality audio for music, podcasts, and voiceovers.  
Total budget target: **under $200**.

The steps below cover:
- choosing the right microphone type  
- connecting and configuring your interface  
- improving room acoustics on a budget  
- recording test audio and troubleshooting  

This guide assumes no prior technical knowledge.

## 1. Choose the Right Microphone

Microphones generally fall into two categories:

### Dynamic Microphones
- Durable  
- Good for untreated/noisy rooms  
- Less sensitive to background noise  
- Great for vocals, podcasting, loud instruments  

**Examples:**  
- [Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/atr2100x-usb?srsltid=AfmBOooVQ6Xro_SIPmlDvzwpsAXsUUfNTZxunKbLgzEtjHoBjAhQi9s-)  
- [Shure SM58](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/microphones/sm58?variant=SM58-LCE)  

### Condenser Microphones
- More sensitive and detailed  
- Capture subtle vocal/instrument nuances  
- Best in quieter or treated rooms  
- Require phantom power (48V)

**Examples:**  
- [Audio-Technica AT2020](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-eu/at2020)  
- [Fifine K669B (budget-friendly)](https://fifinemicrophone.com/products/fifine-k669-669b-usb-microphone)

## 2. Connect Your Audio Interface

A simple 2-input USB audio interface is ideal.

**Examples:**  
- [Focusrite Scarlett Solo](https://focusrite.com/products/scarlett-solo-3rd-gen?selectedLocale=GB&setCurrencyId=1&sku=MOSC0024&tw_source=google&tw_adid=757309221820&tw_campaign=22652364141&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22652364141&gbraid=0AAAAADkSndUU30h2QKinAFubOtah_eg9u&gclid=CjwKCAiAw9vIBhBBEiwAraSATlsgqASDfI7JwVtTztYB8kHnNxWMGXXkB1DEvOf5kDoKDOholGI6IhoCegIQAvD_BwE)  
- [Behringer UMC22 (low-cost option)](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0805-AAJ)

### Setup Steps
1. Connect the interface to your computer using USB
2. Install drivers if required
3. Plug the microphone into the XLR input  
4. Turn on **48V Phantom Power** if using a condenser mic **(check your audio interface manual for the switch location)**
5. Set the **gain** so loud peaks sit between **-12 dB and -6 dB**

*Tip: Red clipping lights = gain too high.*

## 3. Improve Your Room Acoustics (Cheaply)

You don't need acoustic foam to make a big improvement.

### Low-cost improvements
- Record in a small room with soft items
- Hang a blanket behind you or over a stand
- Use pillows/cushions to reduce reflections
- Face a closet full of clothes (natural vocal booth)

### Avoid
- Large empty rooms  
- Hard surfaces  
- Bare walls

## 4. Optimize Your DAW Settings

These recommendations apply to most software (Audacity, Reaper, Logic, Ableton).

### Sample Rate
- **44.1 kHz** for music  
- **48 kHz** for video  

### Bit Depth
- **24-bit** for cleaner recordings  

### Buffer Size
- **128–256 samples** for recording  
- **512+ samples** for mixing  

These settings reduce latency and prevent pops/clicks.

## 5. Record a Test and Troubleshoot

### Test Checklist
- Speak/sing at normal volume  
- Check input levels (aim for -12 dB)  
- Listen back with headphones  
- Record 10 seconds of silence to check noise  

### Common Problems and Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|------|--------|------|
| Hiss/static | Gain too high | Lower gain; move closer to mic |
| Echo/roominess | Untreated room | Add blankets/pillows; face closet |
| Clipping/distortion | Input too hot | Reduce gain; adjust distance |
| Low volume | Low gain | Increase gain or proximity |
| Latency | Buffer too large | Reduce buffer to 128–256 |

## 6. Final Checklist
- Mic 6–8 inches from mouth  
- Pop filter or windscreen used  
- Peaks around -12 dB  
- Room reflections minimized  
- DAW settings correct  
- Monitoring via headphones
