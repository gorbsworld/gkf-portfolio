**Reflection:**  
This guide reflects how I think as a technical writer: I identify where users are most likely to get stuck, surface error messages they will actually see, and offer a mix of quick-glance explanations and detailed solutions. It also shows my familiarity with modern GitHub practices, such as the requirement for personal access tokens (PATs) over passwords.
