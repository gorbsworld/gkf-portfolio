# The Physics of Sound Waves: What Podcasters Need to Know About Frequency and EQ

## Overview

If you create a podcast, you’re already working with sound in a hands-on way — recording voices, shaping tone, adjusting clarity. But behind every decision sits a simple set of physical principles. Understanding the basics of **how sound works** helps you make smarter choices when recording and equalizing audio.

This explainer breaks down the physics of sound into clear, practical concepts specifically for podcasters. No complex maths, no engineering background required — just a friendly guide to what’s happening behind the scenes every time you hit record.

## 1. What Sound Actually Is

At its core, **sound is vibration**.

When someone speaks:

- Their vocal cords vibrate  
- This vibration pushes air molecules around  
- Those molecules bump into others  
- The pattern travels through the air  
- Your microphone captures the changes in air pressure  

Think of sound as a **wave of pressure changes** moving through the air.

A simple way to picture it:

- **High-pressure areas** = molecules bunched together  
- **Low-pressure areas** = molecules spread apart  
- These compressions and rarefactions travel outward like ripples on water

Your microphone turns this pattern into an electrical or digital signal your computer can record.

## 2. Frequency: Why Some Sounds Are Low and Others Are Bright

**Frequency** describes *how fast* a sound wave vibrates.

- Measured in **Hertz (Hz)**  
- 1 Hz = one vibration (cycle) per second  
- Higher frequencies = faster vibrations = “brighter,” “sharper” sounds  
- Lower frequencies = slower vibrations = “deeper,” “boomier” sounds  

### Vocal frequency ranges you’ll actually deal with:

| Frequency | What it sounds like | Role in speech |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|
| **80–150 Hz** | Low end | Body, warmth (especially male voices) |
| **150–500 Hz** | Lower mids | Fullness, chest resonance |
| **1–3 kHz** | Upper mids | Intelligibility — where clarity lives |
| **4–8 kHz** | Presence / brightness | Crispness, articulation |
| **10–14 kHz** | Air | Sibilance, breathiness |

For podcasters, the most important range is **1–3 kHz**, because that’s where spoken-word clarity is strongest.

## 3. Wavelength: Why Your Room Sounds the Way It Does

If frequency is “how fast,” **wavelength** is “how long.”

High frequencies = short wavelengths  
Low frequencies = long wavelengths

### Why this matters in real rooms:

- Short wavelengths (highs) bounce off small surfaces easily  
- Long wavelengths (lows) need bigger spaces to move, so they build up in corners or cause boomy resonance  

That’s why a closet recording often sounds dull (absorbs highs) but still muddy (lows don’t fit and bounce unpredictably).

Understanding wavelength helps you treat your recording space more effectively — you don’t need expensive foam to make better decisions.

## 4. Amplitude: How Loudness Is Represented in Waves

**Amplitude** is the height of the sound wave — essentially, how much energy the wave carries.

- Higher amplitude = louder  
- Lower amplitude = quieter  

Amplitude is what your microphone gain and your DAW’s input meters are measuring.

But amplitude also interacts with **perceived loudness**, which depends on frequency.

Humans hear midrange frequencies more easily than very high or low ones, which is why a small boost at 3 kHz can feel louder than a bigger boost at 100 Hz.

## 5. What Equalization (EQ) Actually Does

An EQ plug-in (like you would find in your DAW) lets you **increase or decrease specific frequencies** within a sound.

Physics explanation:  
You’re reshaping the wave by emphasising or reducing certain vibration speeds.

Practical explanation:  
You’re deciding which parts of the voice should stand out.

### The three core EQ controls:

#### **1. Frequency**  
Which part of the sound spectrum you’re adjusting.

#### **2. Gain**  
How much you’re boosting or cutting (measured in dB).

#### **3. Q (Bandwidth)**  
How wide or narrow the adjustment is.

- **Wide Q** = gentle, natural changes  
- **Narrow Q** = surgical cuts or boosts  

For speech, wide adjustments usually sound more natural.

## 6. Practical EQ Tips Based on The Physics

### ✔ Add clarity  
Boost **1–3 kHz** gently.  
This enhances intelligibility — our ears are tuned to this range.

### ✔ Reduce muddiness  
Cut **200–400 Hz** if the voice sounds “boxy” or “cloudy.”  
These frequencies often build up in small rooms.

### ✔ Control harshness  
If the voice sounds sharp or piercing, consider cutting around **3–5 kHz**.

### ✔ Tame sibilance  
If you hear too much “sss” or “shhh,” cut around **6–8 kHz**.

### ✔ Add air  
A small high-shelf boost around **10–12 kHz** can add polish.

## 7. Why Understanding This Makes You a Better Podcaster

Most podcasters rely on presets or trial-and-error EQ adjustments. But once you understand:

- how sound waves move  
- how frequency translates to tone  
- how rooms shape what the mic hears  
- how EQ manipulates the physics  

…you begin to make intentional, repeatable decisions.

This creates:

- clearer recordings  
- more consistent tone  
- less time fixing problems in post  
- more professional results

Even a little physics goes a long way.
