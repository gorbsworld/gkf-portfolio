# Metadata — The Physics of Sound Waves: What Podcasters Need to Know About Frequency and EQ

**Context:**  
Self-initiated conceptual explainer aimed at bridging academic audio knowledge with practical podcast production.

**Audience:**  
Beginner–intermediate podcasters who want to better understand audio fundamentals without needing engineering or physics expertise.

**Purpose:**  
To demonstrate my ability to explain complex technical concepts (acoustics, wave physics, EQ behavior) in plain language while maintaining scientific accuracy.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Concept explanation for non-technical audiences  
- Information distillation  
- Use of diagrams/analogies  
- Structured, progressive teaching  
- Domain expertise in audio and acoustics  

**Tools Used:**  
Markdown, audio theory, content design principles.

**Reflection:**
