## 1. Hardware Setup

### 1.1 Microphone
We’ll use a **dynamic USB/XLR microphone**, e.g., Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB.  
- Connect the microphone to the Scarlett Solo XLR input  
- Secure the mic on a boom stand at **6–8 inches** from your mouth  
- Optional: attach a pop filter or windscreen to reduce plosives

### 1.2 Scarlett Solo Interface
1. Plug the Scarlett Solo into your computer using the supplied USB cable  
2. Turn on the interface (it’s bus-powered; lights indicate connection)  
3. Adjust the **Gain knob** on the front so the **Halo LED** peaks in the green zone when you speak at normal volume*
   
*_If your podcast might include laughter or raised voices, test gain levels accordingly._

> **Tip:** Red LED = clipping; lower the gain until the green zone is reached

### 1.3 Headphones
- Connect headphones to the **Headphone output** (_you may need a 3.5mm to 6.35mm adapter_)
- Use headphones to monitor your voice and prevent speaker feedback

## 2. Audacity Setup
1. Open **Audacity**  
2. In the top menu:  
   - Set **Audio Host** to “MME” (Windows) or “Core Audio” (Mac)  
   - Select **Scarlett Solo** as the recording device  
   - Set playback device to your headphones  
3. Click the **microphone dropdown** and ensure the correct input channel is selected (usually “Mono 1 (Focusrite USB)”)  
4. Set recording levels:  
   - Speak at normal volume and watch the input meter  
   - Aim for peaks around **-12 dB**  
   - Adjust audio peaks with the Scarlett Solo gain knob if needed

## 3. Recording a Test Track
1. Click the **Record** button in Audacity  
2. Speak naturally for **10–15 seconds**  
3. Click **Stop**  
4. Playback your recording using headphones  
5. Check for:  
   - Hiss or static

   - Echo or excessive room noise

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Hiss or static | Gain too high or poor USB connection | Lower Gain knob; check USB cable; move closer to mic |
| Clipping/distortion | Input too hot | Reduce Gain knob; move mic slightly farther away |
| Room echo | Untreated reflective surfaces | Hang a blanket behind mic; record in smaller room; face closet with clothes |
