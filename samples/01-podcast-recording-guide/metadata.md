**Audience:**  
Beginner podcasters or content creators using affordable tools (Focusrite Scarlett Solo + Audacity) who need simple, reliable instructions to achieve clean voice recordings.

To show competence in procedural documentation, hardware/software setup guidance, and accessibility of language for non-technical users. This piece demonstrates how I break down physical setup, signal flow, gain staging, and basic recording workflow.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Step-by-step instructional writing  
- Clear explanation of hardware and software concepts  
- Accessibility for complete beginners  
- Task-based documentation structure  
- Use of Markdown for documentation

**Reflection:**  
This tutorial highlights my ability to teach complex or unfamiliar tools to new users in a practical and reassuring way. It combines hardware setup, software configuration, and workflow explanations while anticipating common problems. It demonstrates my comfort with audio devices and my technical-writing approach rooted in clarity, empathy, and thorough testing.
