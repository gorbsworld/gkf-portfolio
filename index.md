# Technical Writing Portfolio — Grant Fennell

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio!  
I come from a background in **Corporate Learning & Development** and **Music Education**, and I specialize in explaining complex technical and creative topics with clarity and structure.  

I'm currently expanding my technical skill set in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Markdown**, and **Git**, and exploring the intersection of **Learning & Development** and **Technical Documentation**.
